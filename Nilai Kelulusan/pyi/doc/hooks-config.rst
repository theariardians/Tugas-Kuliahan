Hook Configuration Options
===============================

As of version 4.4, |PyInstaller| implements a mechanism for passing
configuration options to the hooks. At the time of writing, this
feature is supported only in :ref:`.spec files <using spec files>` and
has no command-line interface equivalent.

The hook configuration options consist of a dictionary that is passed
to the ``Analysis`` object via the ``hooksconfig`` argument. The keys
of the dictionary represent `hook identifiers` while the values are
dictionaries of hook-specific keys and values that correspond to
hook settings:


.. code-block:: python

    a = Analysis(["program.py"],
                ...,
                hooksconfig={
                    "some_hook_id": {
                        "foo": ["entry1", "entry2"],
                        "bar": 42,
                        "enable_x": True,
                    },
                    "another_hook_id": {
                        "baz": "value",
                    }
                },
                ...)

Supported hooks and options
===========================

This section lists hooks that implement support for configuration
options. For each hook (or group of hooks), we provide the `hook
identifier` and the list of supported options.

GObject introspection (gi) hooks
--------------------------------

The options passed under `gi` hook identifier control the collection
of GLib/Gtk resources (themes, icons, translations) in various
hooks related to ``GObject introspection`` (i.e., ``hook-gi.*``).

They are especially useful when freezing ``Gtk3``-based applications on
linux, as they allow one to limit the amount of themes and icons collected
from the system ``/usr/share`` directory.

**Hook identifier:** ``gi``

**Options**

 * ``languages`` [*list of strings*]: list of locales (e.g., ˙en_US˙) for
   which translations should be collected. By default, ``gi`` hooks
   collect all available translations.

 * ``icons`` [*list of strings*]: list of icon themes (e.g., `Adwaita`)
   that shoud be collected. By default, ``gi`` hooks collect all available
   icon themes.

 * ``themes`` [*list of strings*]: list of Gtk themes (e.g., `Adwaita`)
   that shoud be collected. By default, ``gi`` hooks collect all available
   icon themes.

**Example**

Collect only ``Adwaita`` theme and icons, and limit the collected
translations to British English and Simplified Chinese:

.. code-block:: python

    a = Analysis(["my-gtk-app.py"],
                 ...,
                 hooksconfig={
                     "gi": {
                         "icons": ["Adwaita"],
                         "themes": ["Adwaita"],
                         "languages": ["en_GB", "zh_CN"]
                     }
                 },
                 ...)




Adding an option to the hook
============================

Implementing support for hook options requires access to ``hook_api``
object, which is available only when hook implements the ``hook(hook_api)``
function (as described :ref:`here <The hook(hook_api) Function>`).

The value of a hook's configuration option can be obtained using the
:func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.get_hook_config` function:

.. code-block:: python

    # hook-mypackage.py
    from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import get_hook_config

    # Processing unrelated to hook options, using global hook values
    binaries, datas, hiddenimports = ...

    # Collect extra data
    def hook(hook_api):
        # Boolean option 'collect_extra_data'
        if get_hook_config(hook_api, 'mypackage', 'collect_extra_data'):
            extra_datas = ...  # Collect extra data
            hook_api.add_datas(extra_datas)


After implementing option handling in the hook, please add a section
documenting it under :ref:`supported hooks and options`, to inform
the users of the option's availability and the meaning of its value(s).

The above hook example allows the user to toggle the collection of extra
data from ``mypackage`` by setting the corresponding option in their
:ref:`.spec file <using spec files>`:

.. code-block:: python

    a = Analysis(["program-using-mypackage.py"],
                 ...,
                 hooksconfig={
                     "mypackage": {
                         "collect_extra_data": True,
                     }
                 },
                 ...)
